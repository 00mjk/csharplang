# Collection literals working group meeting for October 14th, 2022

This is the third meeting of the collection literals working group. The proposal is currently located at #5354.

## Agenda

* `Span<T>` and *stack allocation*

Supporting `Span<T>` (and `ReadOnlySpan<T>`) is considered very important for completeness for the feature.  *Stack allocation* (i.e. `stackalloc`) of data is also considered highly desirable, both for the ability to avoid encurring a GC cost, and to avoid any overhead when the literal itself isn't observed, but only its elements are.

However, *stack allocation* is a very dangerous  well.  It can trivially cause stack explosions when not used carefully.

It turns out this space is being heavily examined in the [`params span`](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/params-span.md) proposal.  We strongly believe that we would want the following to be equivalent:

```c#
void M(params ReadOnlySpan<int> values);
M(1, 2, 3, 4);   // as params span
M([1, 2, 3, 4]); // as direct span
```

As such, our position is to align ourselves here with whatever the `params span` working group comes up with for using spans and `stackalloc`.  Currently, that spec says that the span:

> will result in an array T[] created on the stack if the params array is within limits (if any) set by the compiler. Otherwise the array will be allocated on the heap.

Following the same approach for colleciton literals would then always allow a literal to construct a `Span<T>`, albeit sometimes using *stack allocation*, and sometimes heap allocation.  We know that there will be some users and some use cases where this is unpalatable.  For example, code which wishes to use a `Span<T>` knowing that it will *only* stack allocate.  To that end, we expect the compiler to issue *hidden* diagnostics (a capability already supported today) when such a span actually involves a heap allocation.  Concerned users would then enable a warning or error for that diagnostic, and could block any cases the compiler doesn't guarantee will be on the stack.

Importantly, we do not anticipate that *stack allocating* means a *direct translation* of a *collection literal expression* to `stackalloc`.  For example, given:

```c#
foreach (...)
{
   Span<T> values = [GetA(), GetB(), GetC()];
   // do things with values
}
```

A simplistic translation to:

```c#
foreach (...)
{
   Span<T> values = stackalloc T[3];
```

would be undesirable.  This would grow the stack on each iteration of the loop, easily leading to an blowup at runtime.  The compiler is allowed to translate that using `stackalloc` however it wants, as long as the `Span` meaning stays the same and [`span-safety`](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/csharp-7.2/span-safety.md) is maintained.  For example, it can translate the above to:

```c#
Span<int> __buffer = stackalloc int[3];
foreach (...)
{
    __buffer[0] = GetA();
    __buffer[1] = GetB();
    __buffer[2] = GetC();
    Span<int> values = __buffer;
    // do things with span.  It would likely be appropriate to clear __buffer when the scope ends.
}
```

This approach ensures the stack does not grow in an unbounded fashion, though it may not be possible in all collection-literal cases.

If the compiler decides to allocate on the heap, the translation for `Span<T>` is simply:

```c#
T[] __array = [...]; // using existing rules
Span<T> __result = __array;
```
